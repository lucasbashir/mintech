        <h4>User Responsibility</h4>
        <p>
            As a user of our platform, it is your responsibility to use the platform righteously and in accordance with the guidelines and principles of the community. We urge you to make every effort to maintain pious and righteous behavior. Here are three verses from the Quran that emphasize the importance of piety:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him]." (Quran 3:102)</p>
            <p>"O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice." (Quran 33:70)</p>
            <p>"And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent." (Quran 65:2-3)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            We expect users to adhere to these principles and use our platform in a manner that upholds righteousness and respect for one another.
        </p>

        <h4>Platform Disassociation</h4>
        <p>
            Our platform disassociates itself from any conducts between individuals that are beyond the reach and control of the platform. While we strive to maintain a positive environment, we are not responsible for the actions and behaviors of individuals outside the platform.
